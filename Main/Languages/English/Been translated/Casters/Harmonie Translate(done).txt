  <!-- EN: {PAWN_nameDef}参加的数次外勤任务里，{PAWN_possessive}队友时常会在报告中形容{PAWN_pronoun}“严苛”“雷厉风行”，而被{PAWN_pronoun}帮助过的队友则说，总觉得自己好像做错了什么事，但对方也没有明说，只是继续按部就班地执行命令，完成任务。\n当然，{PAWN_pronoun}本人的报告还是和{PAWN_pronoun}平时的态度一样散漫。\n				 -->
  <AK_Trait_Harmonie.degreeDatas.0.description>In the numerous field missions {PAWN_pronoun} has undertaken, {PAWN_possessive}'s teammates frequently describe her in their reports as "unforgiving" along with "swift and decisive," while those {PAWN_pronoun}'s helped out are often left feeling like they've made some kind of mistake–not that she actually tells them as such; she simply continues to carry out her orders, completing her mission in a rote manner. \nIt goes without saying, but just as Harmonie herself is typically lax, her own reports are every bit as sloppy.</AK_Trait_Harmonie.degreeDatas.0.description>
