  <!-- EN: Her mother had left the house, a noise Gladiia could recognise. She pulls a small, vanity hand mirror from beneath her pillow. Under typical circumstance, she wouldn't be awake at such time. Though, tonight, she needed to look at herself, she needed to choose. In the eyes of others, she is the daughter of key Academy of Sciences personnel, winner of all youth competitions, a family girl, and a young success story. But, through the eyes of herself, she saw little more than a carbon-based robot. She believed her mother sought accomplishment from her, so she compelled herself to greater and greater lengths, and accomplishments. But, regardless of her efforts, she remained secondary to the eyes of her mother, never able to pry feedback of any sort. The only conclusion she could reach is that this household was an accident with no reason to exist. It was for this that Gladiia had made a decision; she will search for it. Search for a place to call "Home," search for Ægir to call "family."。 -->
